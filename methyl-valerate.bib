  abstract = {Fundamental experimental measurements of quantities including ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, and species profiles serve important roles in understanding fuel chemistry and validating chemical kinetic models. However, despite both the importance and abundance of such information in the literature, the community lacks a widely adopted standard format for this data. This impedes both sharing and wide use by the community. In this paper, we introduce a new Chemical Kinetics Experimental Data format, ChemKED, and the related Python-based package for creating and validating ChemKED-formatted files called PyKED. We will also review past and related efforts, and motivate the need for a new solution. ChemKED currently supports the representation of autoignition delay time and laminar flame speed measurements. ChemKED-formatted files contain all of the information needed to simulate experimental data points, including the uncertainty of the data. ChemKED is based on the YAML data serialization language, and is intended as a human- and machine-readable standard for easy creation and automated use. Development of ChemKED and PyKED occurs openly on GitHub under the BSD 3-clause license, and contributions from the community are welcome. Plans for future development include support for experimental data from jet stirred reactor, extinction, and speciation measurements.},

  abstract = {Due to the world's over-reliance on fossil fuels there has been a developing interest in the production of renewable biofuels such as methyl and ethyl esters derived from vegetable oils and animal fats. To increase our understanding of the combustion chemistry of esters, the oxidation of methyl butanoate and ethyl propanoate, both with a molecular formula of C5H10O2, have been studied in a series of high-temperature shock tube experiments. Ignition delay times for a series of mixtures, of varying fuel/oxygen equivalence ratios (phi = 0.25-1.5), were measured behind reflected shock waves over the temperature range 1100-1670 K, and at pressures of 1.0, and 4.0 atm. It was found that ethyl propanoate was consistently faster to ignite than methyl butanoate, particularly at lower temperatures. Detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms have been assembled and used to simulate these experiments with good agreement observed. Rate of production analyses using the detailed mechanisms shows that the faster reactivity of ethyl propanoate can be explained by a six-centered unimolecular decomposition reaction with a relatively low activation energy barrier producing propanoic acid and ethylene. The elimination reaction itself is not responsible for the increased reactivity; it is the faster reactivity of the two products, propanoic acid and ethylene that leads to this behavior.},

  abstract = {A general framework is presented for accurately and efficiently estimating the phenomenological pressure-dependent rate coefficients for reaction networks of arbitrary size and complexity using only high-pressure-limit information. Two aspects of this framework are discussed in detail. First, two methods of estimating the density of states of the species in the network are presented, including a new method based on characteristic functional group frequencies. Second, three methods of simplifying the full master equation model of the network to a single set of phenomenological rates are discussed, including a new method based on the reservoir state and pseudo-steady state approximations. Both sets of methods are evaluated in the context of the chemically-activated reaction of acetyl with oxygen. All three simplifications of the master equation are usually accurate, but each fails in certain situations, which are discussed. The new methods usually provide good accuracy at a computational cost appropriate for automated reaction mechanism generation.},
